# atm
While I was doing my internship at [Grimme](https://grimme.com/de), I wrote a program for an atm in C#. It was my first time coding in an object-oriented programming language.

## The program itself
The program includes two bank accounts. They belong to the fictional characters Lisa and Paul. The bank details of those accounts are accessible in the program (PIN, etc). It is an interactive program which embodies basic functionalities of an atm. You may insert money, withdraw or transfer money to a loved one by entering the desired amount. After performing some transactions, you may request a statement of your activities. The printed statement will solely display the current transactions because there is no database which backs up the program. Nonetheless, it has features such as referring to you (Lisa/Paul) personally by name and displaying your updated account balance directly after your transaction.
